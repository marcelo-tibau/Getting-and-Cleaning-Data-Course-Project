# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
# This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Johns Hopkins "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.
# The dataset being used is "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones", available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

# The R script, run_analysis.R does the following:
## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
## From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# This 5 steps can be launched in RStudio by importing the script.
# The output for step 5 is the file named tidy_data.txt, also uploaded to this repo.
